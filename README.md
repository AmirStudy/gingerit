gingerit
========

Python wrapper for correcting spelling and grammar mistakes based on the context of complete sentences.


## Usage

```python
from gingerit import GingerIt

text = 'The smelt of fliwers bring back memories.'

parser = GingerIt()
parser.parse(text)

```

## TODO:

 - I'm still working on the parsing. 
 - Python packaging (PYPI)
 - Tests
 - Get Rid of requests ?
